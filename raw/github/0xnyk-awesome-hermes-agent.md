# Awesome Hermes Agent

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of skills, tools, integrations, and resources for enhancing your [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) workflow — the self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).

Hermes Agent is the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, and as of v0.12.0 maintains its own skill library through an autonomous Curator that grades, consolidates, and prunes on a 7-day cycle. It searches its own past conversations and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure (seven terminal backends including Vercel Sandbox, Daytona, and Modal). Talk to it from any of 18 built-in messaging platforms — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Feishu/Lark, WeCom, QQBot, Yuanbao, and more — plus Microsoft Teams via plugin.

This list tracks the growing ecosystem around it.

## Where Do I Start?

New to Hermes? Don't try to install everything at once. Here's the three-step path from zero to productive:

1. **Get running** — Follow the [Official Docs quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/). It covers installation, CLI, configuration, and your first conversation.
2. **Add your first skills** — Install [wondelai/skills](https://github.com/wondelai/skills) (380+ stars, actively maintained) — a cross-platform skills library that works with Hermes and other agents. Or try [litprog-skill](https://github.com/tlehman/litprog-skill) (75+ stars) for literate programming across Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes.
3. **Get a GUI** — Set up [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) (500+ stars) for a Hermes-native workspace with chat, terminal, and skills manager. Or use [mission-control](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control) (3.7k+ stars) for a broader agent orchestration dashboard with fleet management, task dispatch, and cost tracking.

Once you're comfortable, explore the full list below. Every resource is tagged with a maturity level so you know what you're getting into:

| Tag | What it means |
|-----|---------------|
| **production** | Stable, documented, actively maintained — safe to build on |
| **beta** | Works but still evolving — expect some rough edges |
| **experimental** | Proof of concept or early-stage — learn from it, don't depend on it |

## Operational Playbooks

> Practical workflow patterns that repeatedly help Hermes teams in production.

- **Nightly self-evolution + guardrail evaluation** — Run [hermes-agent-self-evolution](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent-self-evolution) on a schedule, then run a second verification cron to score quality and block optimization-loop gaming.
- **Memory pressure handling with Honcho/Hindsight** — If you are repeating context or losing long-term recall, review [Honcho Memory docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/honcho), and evaluate [hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) or self-hosted memory backends.
- **Tune session timeout/expiry early** — Use [configuration docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration/) to adjust session retention for slower-moving threads so context is kept when needed.
- **OpenClaw side-by-side migration** — Keep both systems running during migration using [openclaw-to-hermes](https://github.com/0xNyk/openclaw-to-hermes) and native Hermes migration paths, then cut over once cron and routing behavior match.
- **Curate USER.md and MEMORY.md intentionally** — Treat profile memory as high-signal infrastructure. Keep entries concise, durable, and preference-focused instead of dumping raw notes.

---

## Level-Up Blueprints

> Opinionated bundles for teams that want to get more out of Hermes quickly without assembling the stack from scratch.

- **Memory stack that actually compounds** — Start with built-in Hermes memory, then add [honcho-self-hosted](https://github.com/elkimek/honcho-self-hosted) when you want stronger cross-session user modeling, [hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) when you need retain/recall/reflect workflows across large histories, and [plur](https://github.com/plur-ai/plur) when you want portable shared memory artifacts in an open engram format. If you also want proactive recall, pair it with [flowstate-qmd](https://github.com/amanning3390/flowstate-qmd).
- **Self-improvement without self-delusion** — Pair [hermes-agent-self-evolution](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent-self-evolution) with scheduled regression checks, [lintlang](https://github.com/roli-lpci/lintlang) for prompt/config linting, and a second evaluation pass that blocks bad prompt mutations. The trick is not “evolve faster”; it’s “evolve without quietly getting weird.”
- **Operator cockpit for real work** — Use [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) for the richest daily UI, [mission-control](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control) when you need multi-agent fleet visibility and cost tracking, and [hermes-webui](https://github.com/sanchomuzax/hermes-webui) if you want a lighter ops surface.
- **Multi-agent execution layer** — Combine Hermes core delegation with [hermes-agent-acp-skill](https://github.com/Rainhoole/hermes-agent-acp-skill) for Codex/Claude Code routing, [zouroboros-swarm-executors](https://github.com/marlandoj/zouroboros-swarm-executors) for local executor handoff, and [opencode-hermes-multiagent](https://github.com/1ilkhamov/opencode-hermes-multiagent) or [bigiron](https://github.com/supermodeltools/bigiron) when you need specialized agent roles.
- **Migration + deployment hardening** — If you are moving from OpenClaw, keep [openclaw-to-hermes](https://github.com/0xNyk/openclaw-to-hermes) in the toolkit even if you prefer the native migration path. For repeatable deploys, look at [nix-hermes-agent](https://github.com/0xrsydn/nix-hermes-agent), [hermes-agent-docker](https://github.com/xmbshwll/hermes-agent-docker), and [evey-setup](https://github.com/42-evey/evey-setup) depending on how opinionated you want the stack to be.
- **Paperclip-managed autonomous ops** — For teams that want Hermes operating inside a governed company workflow, combine [hermes-paperclip-adapter](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-paperclip-adapter) with Hermes cron jobs and one of the operator dashboards above. That gives you task governance, approvals, and actual operational continuity instead of a clever demo that forgets what it was doing.
